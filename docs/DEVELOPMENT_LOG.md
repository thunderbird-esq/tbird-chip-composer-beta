## [2025-06-13] Initial Application Scaffolding and Basic Playback

- **Implemented Core Application Structure**:
    - Created `src/main.js` as the central coordinator for all application modules. This script handles the initialization sequence of the audio engine, UI panels, tracker grid, and transport controls.
    - Updated `index.html` to defer-load `src/main.js`, ensuring all component scripts are available before initialization logic runs.

- **Activated UI Components**:
    - `PanelManager` (`src/ui/panels.js`): Initialized to create and display default control panels (Instrument Editor, Project Settings, Sample Library placeholder).
    - `TrackerGrid` (`src/ui/grid.js`): Initialized to render the main pattern editor table with sample data.
    - `TransportControl` (`src/ui/transport.js`): Initialized to display playback buttons (Play, Pause, Stop, Record).

- **Enabled Basic Audio Functionality**:
    - `AudioEngine` (`src/audio/engine.js`):
        - Successfully initializes the Web Audio API `AudioContext`.
        - Implemented a rudimentary `setInterval`-based sequencer for playback timing.
        - `scheduleNote` method now generates a basic sound (oscillator with a simple gain envelope) when called.
        - `playStepData` method fetches note data from the `TrackerGrid` for the current sequencer step.
        - Added `isPlaying` and `isPaused` states to track playback status.

- **Integrated UI and Audio**:
    - `TrackerGrid` now provides pattern data to the `AudioEngine` via a `getStepData` method.
    - `AudioEngine` receives the `TrackerGrid` instance from `main.js`.
    - `TransportControl` buttons (Play, Stop) now trigger `AudioEngine.startPlayback()` and `AudioEngine.stopPlayback()`.
    - Button states in `TransportControl` (enabled/disabled) are synchronized with the `AudioEngine`'s `isPlaying` and `isPaused` states, providing visual feedback.

- **Outcome**:
    - The application now loads in a browser, displays its core UI elements, and can play back simple sounds based on the sample data in the tracker grid when the "Play" button is pressed. "Stop" halts playback. This forms the foundational "work out of the box" experience.

## [2025-06-13] Enhanced Audio, UI Interactivity, Playback Control, and Basic File I/O

**1. Enhanced Audio Engine & Sound Generation**:
    *   **Note Parsing**: Implemented `AudioEngine.parseNoteString()` to convert tracker-style note strings (e.g., "C-4", "F#3") into playable frequencies, handling sharps and octaves.
    *   **Basic Instrument System**:
        *   `AudioEngine` now manages a collection of instruments, each definable by an ID, name, waveform (sine, square, sawtooth, triangle), and an Attack-Decay envelope.
        *   `scheduleNote` in `AudioEngine` generates sound based on the active instrument's parameters.
        *   Sample instruments are loaded by default in `main.js`.
    *   **Improved Sequencer Timing**: Replaced the initial `setInterval`-based sequencer with a more precise `setTimeout`-based scheduler using Web Audio API's timing. This provides more stable and accurate playback.
    *   **Tempo (BPM) Control**:
        *   `AudioEngine`'s BPM is now configurable via `setBPM()` method.
        *   Initial BPM is loaded from `config.json` at startup (defaulting if file or value is missing).

**2. Developed UI Functionality**:
    *   **Tracker Grid Interaction**:
        *   Implemented cell selection via mouse clicks.
        *   Added keyboard navigation using arrow keys to move the selected cell.
        *   Enabled basic keyboard note entry for the 'note' column: users can set note letters (A-G), change octaves (0-7), toggle sharps (#), and clear notes (Delete/Backspace).
    *   **Instrument Editor Panel**:
        *   The panel now displays an editable form for instrument properties (waveform, attack, decay), pre-populated with data for a sample instrument ('01').
        *   Users can modify these parameters and click an "Update" button to apply changes to the instrument definition in the `AudioEngine`.
    *   **Project Settings Panel**:
        *   The panel now includes an input field for BPM, initialized with the current project BPM.
        *   An "Update Settings" button allows users to change the BPM, which updates the `AudioEngine`'s tempo in real-time.
    *   **Audio Visualizer**:
        *   Implemented `Visualizer` class (`src/ui/visualizer.js`) that connects to `AudioEngine`'s output via an `AnalyserNode`.
        *   Renders a real-time time-domain (waveform) representation of the audio output onto a canvas element.

**3. Refined Playback & Control**:
    *   **Pause/Resume Functionality**: Ensured true pause and resume capability. The `AudioEngine` can pause its precise scheduler, and UI buttons (Play/Pause/Stop) in `TransportControl` correctly reflect and control this state.
    *   **Pattern Looping**: Verified that the sequencer correctly loops from the last step back to the first, based on the number of rows in the `TrackerGrid`.
    *   **Playback Row Highlighting**: The currently playing row in the `TrackerGrid` is now visually highlighted, providing clear feedback on playback position. This is achieved via a callback mechanism from `AudioEngine` to `TrackerGrid`.

**4. Basic File I/O (localStorage)**:
    *   **Project Saving**: Implemented functionality to save the entire project state (current BPM, all instrument definitions, and full pattern data from `TrackerGrid`) to the browser's `localStorage`. This is triggered by a "Save Project" button in the Project Settings panel.
    *   **Project Loading**: Implemented functionality to load a previously saved project from `localStorage`. This restores BPM, instruments, and pattern data, and updates the UI accordingly. Triggered by a "Load Project" button.
    *   Helper functions `gatherProjectData` and `applyProjectData` were added in `main.js` to manage this process.
    *   `TrackerGrid` and `AudioEngine` were enhanced with methods to get/set their respective data (`getPatternData`, `setPatternData`, `getInstrumentsData`, `loadInstrumentsData`).

**Overall State**:
The application is now significantly more functional, offering a more interactive composition experience with configurable sound, visual feedback during playback, and the ability to save and load work.
