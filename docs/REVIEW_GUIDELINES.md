# Review Guidelines

To ensure quality, every contribution must pass these criteria:

- ✅ `index.html` launches without errors in Chrome and Firefox
- ✅ `dev-panel.html` responds to UI actions and triggers audio
- ✅ `test-runner.html` loads test modules successfully
- ✅ `build.sh` runs without critical errors (minimal behavior OK)
- ✅ All console logs must be informative — no placeholder messages
- ✅ No placeholder `TODO` text in any committed file
- ✅ `package.json`, `README.md`, and `config.json` must contain project-specific values
